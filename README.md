# rox-client-grunt

> Utilities for ROX Center clients using Grunt.

[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/rox-client-grunt.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/rox-client-grunt)

*This module was originally a standalone ROX Center client.
This is no longer the case.
The standalone client for grunt-contrib-jasmine is now [rox-client-grunt-contrib-jasmine](https://github.com/lotaris/rox-client-grunt-contrib-jasmine).*



## Usage

Add it to your development dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev rox-client-grunt
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line:
 
```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('rox-client-grunt');
```
